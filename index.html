        <li class="letter-space">Internal- by using a style elemnt in the head section</li>
        <li class="letter-space">External- by using a link element tyo link to an external CSS file</li>
        <li class="letter-space">The most common way to add CSS. is to keep the styles in external CSS files. 
            however, <span class="background">in this tutitorial we will use inline and internal styles,</span> 
            because this is easier to demonstrate,and easier for you to try it yourself.</li>

    <div class="big-font brown-font">When comparing CSS class vs ID,the differnce is that CSS class applies a style to multiple elements.ID, on the other hand,applies a style to one unique element. ID is also special in that you can use a special URL.to link directly to an element and it's used by JavaSript.</div>
    <br>
    <div class="small-font brown-font">In CSS, selectors are used to target a specific element or range of elements on a webpage. Once an element has been targeted, a style or set of styles can be applied to the elements.</div>
    <br>
    <div class="itallic bold brown-font">There is a wide range of selectors avialable.Two of the most commonly used are class and ID. 
        Both are used to target elements to which a style should be applied</div>
